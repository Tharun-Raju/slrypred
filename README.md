# **Linear Regression Model for Salary Prediction Based on Years of Experience**

This repository contains a simple implementation of a linear regression model to predict salaries based on years of experience. The model is built using Python and scikit-learn and is intended to demonstrate how to perform basic regression analysis on a dataset.

## **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that estimates the salary of an individual based on their years of experience. The process includes:

- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Training a linear regression model.
- Evaluating the model's performance using key metrics.
- Visualizing the relationship between experience and salary.
- Testing the model by predicting salaries for given years of experience.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, removes unnecessary columns (e.g., 'Unnamed: 0'), and splits the data into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training:** Utilizes the scikit-learn `LinearRegression` class to fit the model to the training data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Calculates performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and the RÂ² Score to assess the model's accuracy.
- **Visualization:** Includes plots to visualize the training and testing results, actual vs. predicted salaries, and residual distributions.
- **Prediction Functionality:** Allows users to input a specific number of years of experience to get a predicted salary using the trained model.
